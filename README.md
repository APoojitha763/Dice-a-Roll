<h1 align="center"> Roll a Dice </h1>



## Game Rules -

This is a two-player game played in rounds.

Each player takes turns rolling a dice as many times as they wish. Each roll's result adds to their round score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their round score resets to zero, and it becomes the other player's turn.

Players can also choose to hold, which means they add their round score to their global score and then pass the turn to the other player.

The first player to reach 100 points in their global score wins the game.
